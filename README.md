# Data Jobs Dashboard

The main pbix file (Visualisaitions.pbix) contains bad data in job_postings_flat table where the columns salary_hour_avg and salary_year_avg are badly formatted according to their data types.
I couldn't find a way to fix this issue so every charts and data models are not right when related to the salaries.
